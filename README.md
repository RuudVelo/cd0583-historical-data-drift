# Historical Data Drift

In this tutorial, we will calculate and visualize historical data drift, which tells us how data has changed.

# Steps to run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.
3. The `expo.py` file contains the code to calculate data drift (the process is the same as the previous tutorial). You can run the file and setup an mlflow server as follows:
    ```bash
    python expo.py & mlflow ui
    ```
